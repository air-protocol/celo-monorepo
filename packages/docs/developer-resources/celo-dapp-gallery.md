# Celo DApp Gallery

Welcome to the DApp Gallery! Here are some featured examples to help you get started building on Celo.

## Savings Circle

Savings Circles let you pool funds with your friends to save for large purchases. They are known by a variety of names around the world and are a common way to get liquidity and access to loans without access to formal financial institutions.

## [Decentralized Impact Incubator](https://blockchainforsocialimpact.com/incubator-winners-2020/) Winners

### Multiply.Charity by Abundance

[Multiply](https://multiply.charity/) the impact of charitable donations by providing liquidity in credit tokens where the legacy financial system fails. Compared to cash donations, like GiveDirectly, this process has two major advantages: The credit tokens 1) fill a demand for liquidity (which banks fail to deliver), thus increasing the incentive to produce goods and services and 2) stay in the local economy longer, resulting in a larger impact (or lower cost overhead) per donation. Early field tests demonstrate up to 20x impact over traditional donations and double the velocity (the rate at which the money is traded) to the US Dollar.

### Bienvenir

## [Celo Camp](https://www.celocamp.com/) Projects  
  
### Pesabase  
  
An integration of a Celo Dollar (Stablecoin) and Mpesa, showing flows of payment between an Mpesa User and a Celo Blockchain wallet from anywhere in the world. Our aim with Pesabase is to provide Africanâ€™s with a cheap and social option to remit and pay for goods and services.

### Wallet as a Service

Tangany's custody solution [Wallet as a Service](https://docs.tangany.com/?version=latest) enables you to create and 
manage HSM-secured wallets and interact with the underlying blockchain. Our API makes it incredibly easy for developers 
to execute transactions, check details of past transactions or query account balances without any worries about private 
key safekeeping. For the Celo Camp 2020 we have developed a prototype version of our product that integrates the Celo blockchain. 
The [demo project](https://github.com/adrianmitter/celo-camp) presents the new features and provides some code snippets to get started.

### impactMarket

[impactMarket](https://github.com/impactMarket) enables any vulnerable community to create its own unconditional basic income system for their beneficiaries, where each one can claim a fixed amount on a regular basis and make payments for free.

### Celo Toolkit by MugglePay

[MugglePay](https://mugglepay.com/) provides a payment SDK for merchants to accept cryptocurrencies. Mugglepay makes crypto payment easy and thousands of merchants are onboarded with MugglePay SDK. For the Celo Camp 2020, we will integrate with cUSD/cGLD for payments on Celo blockchain.

[Celo Toolkit](https://celo.mugglepay.com) is the [open source](https://github.com/MugglePay/celo-toolkit) interface for managing Celo accounts on Web. Celo developer might start with a funded Celo account (Testnet) now in 1 minute. Phone number or app downloads are not necessary.

### Dunia Pay Wallet 

At Dunia Payment, we are building an electronic wallet that will let people in Sub Saharan Africa send and receive money directly on their phone.The app will use the Celo light client to process transactions faster, even in low internet connection areas common in Africa. The wallet will be built on top of the Celo platform and also using a set of external open source smart contracts.

### Syklo by Air Protocol 

Syklo is the first peer-to-peer mobile application, on [Air Protocol](https://www.airprotocol.org), that allows users to send remittances from anywhere in the world. It also serves as a digital wallet to store USDs thus enabling users to save in a stable currency.

Through its use of the Celo blockchain, implemented on Air Protocol, it creates dynamic multisig escrows (using a threshold of 2/3). The escrows enable users to be confident their crypto payment is safe while sending their off-chain (P2P) transaction, such as sending USD via PayPal. If the exchange goes smoothly then the escrow is released, however if something goes sideways, then a mediation team can give a ruling and sign the release of the escrow to the appropriate user.

This app is one example of what developers can achieve by using Celo and the Air Protocol. Air Protocol provides the infrastructure to create decentralized P2P transactions and Celo provides the blockchain to exchange and store the crypto assets safely.

To download Syklo Android apk click [here](https://www.airprotocol.org/syklo-v1.apk)
For Syklo iOS app, we'll be sharing through TestFlight, so please share your TestFlight account [here](https://forms.gle/1oLc9S8n71bK7sTi6) 

Coming soon! We'll open source Syklo code too, so anyone can use it or change it for their needs :) 

Note: To be able to accept offers in "Market", please fund your account (you can find it on the menu -> Wallet) by using the following [link](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) or wait for someone to accept your transaction after making a proposal of "Add funds" (menu -> Add funds)
